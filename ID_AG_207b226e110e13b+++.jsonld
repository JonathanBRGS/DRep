    "comment": "We have decided to vote no because, although the proposal seeks to simplify and update the Constitution of the Cardano Blockchain Ecosystem, it removes important controls that ensure transparency and accountability in the management of the treasury resources by eliminating the requirement for budgetary approval for withdrawals. This change may weaken financial oversight and increase the risk of misuse of community funds. Additionally, the removal of codes of conduct for DReps and SPOs may create gaps in the definition of ethical and behavioral standards essential for trust and integrity within the ecosystem. Excessive simplification may also obscure crucial details for governance, compromising the legal and operational security of the system. For these reasons, we believe the proposal does not provide sufficient guarantees to ensure the protection and proper functioning of the Cardano ecosystem, and it is preferable to maintain the current structure until there is clear consensus on the changes."
