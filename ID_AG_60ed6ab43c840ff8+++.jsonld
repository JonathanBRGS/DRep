    "comment": "We vote yes because this proposal directly strengthens Cardano’s decentralization and security by developing a **new modular, interoperable, and open-source block-producing node**.\n\nThe Amaru project offers a concrete alternative to the current node, reducing centralization risks and increasing network resilience. It is managed by a **multi-entity committee** (PRAGMA), ensuring neutrality and preventing concentration of power.\n\nFunds will be managed through **audited smart contracts** that only allow spending within the approved scope and record all transactions with on-chain metadata, facilitating audits and ensuring full transparency. Additionally, an independent financial auditor is planned to reinforce accountability to the community.\n\nThe proposal complies with the **Cardano Constitution** and respects established budget limits, following good governance practices. Supporting Amaru means investing in greater diversity, security, and sustainability for Cardano’s infrastructure, keeping it open and community-controlled.\n"
