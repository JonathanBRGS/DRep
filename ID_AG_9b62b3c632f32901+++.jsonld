    "comment": "While we agree with the need for predictability and sustainability with Cardano's Treasury, we disagree with the proposed measures. Establishing percentage limits would be the best way to provide predictability and sustainability to the Treasury. See Constitutional Amendment No. 95 of 2016 of the Federative Republic of Brazil, which establishes that the growth rate of public spending will be limited to the percentage growth of the national GDP. Despite the many problems of the Brazilian administration, Constitutional Amendment No. 95 of 2016 is commendable, as it creates self-adjusting measures to the market.\nWe do not consider it prudent to approve GAs that require subsequent approvals. The proposed results and effects of GAs should depend as little as possible on the approval of other GAs. The GA is based on analytical studies that are not duly proven in time. For these reasons, we vote no.\nWe respectfully ask that you improve the proposal so that we can agree in the future."
